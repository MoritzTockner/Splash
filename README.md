# Splash
Unity 2D Game

You can control an aquarium (via drag and drop) and you have to get the poor fish back into the see. 
When the fish enters the aquarium, he tries to jump as hard as he can out of the water,
and you have to catch him again with the aquarium to prevent the fish from hitting the ground.

The fish can get more momentum for his jump, depending on where he enters the water in the aquarium.
Watch out for evil birds and cats. They want to eat your poor little fish.
